abstract: "Background: As phenotypes of depressive disorders (DD) are highly heterogenous, a growing number of studies investigate person-specific associations of depressive symptoms in time series data. Most available methods for estimating applicable models rely on the assumption that the associations between variables stay constant over time, which can be unrealistic in clinical contexts. To circumvent this limitation, we used a recently developed technique to estimate time-varying vector autoregressive models. Methods: In daily diary data of 20 participants with DD with a mean length of 274 days (SD = 82.4, range = 154-539), we modeled idiographic associations between core depressive symptoms, rumination, sleep, and quantity and quality of social contacts as idiographic time-varying dynamical networks. Results: Resulting models showed marked inter- as well as intraindividual differences. For some participants, associations between variables changed fast over time, whereas for others they showed more stability. Our results further indicated nonstationarity in all time series. Discussion: Idiographic symptom networks of depression can be of interest to clinicians and researchers as they can capture changes over time and provide detailed insights into the temporal course of mental disorders. Whilst the assumption of stationarity can hinder insights into important change processes, time-varying network models are a promising approach. We discuss limitations, their possible solutions, and recommendations for further use of the modeling technique."
# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: We investigated person-specific symptom associations and their changes over time in 20 individuals with depression. We used a recently developed technique to estimate time-varying vector autoregressive models to model idiographic associations between core depressive symptoms, rumination, sleep, and quantity and quality of social contacts as idiographic time-varying dynamical networks.
