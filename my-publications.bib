  abstract = {Background: As phenotypes of depressive disorders (DD) are highly heterogenous, a growing number of studies investigate person-specific associations of depressive symptoms in time series data. Most available methods for estimating applicable models rely on the assumption that the associations between variables stay constant over time, which can be unrealistic in clinical contexts. To circumvent this limitation, we used a recently developed technique to estimate time-varying vector autoregressive models. Methods: In daily diary data of 20 participants with DD with a mean length of 274 days (SD = 82.4, range = 154-539), we modeled idiographic associations between core depressive symptoms, rumination, sleep, and quantity and quality of social contacts as idiographic time-varying dynamical networks. Results: Resulting models showed marked inter- as well as intraindividual differences. For some participants, associations between variables changed fast over time, whereas for others they showed more stability. Our results further indicated nonstationarity in all time series. Discussion: Idiographic symptom networks of depression can be of interest to clinicians and researchers as they can capture changes over time and provide detailed insights into the temporal course of mental disorders. Whilst the assumption of stationarity can hinder insights into important change processes, time-varying network models are a promising approach. We discuss limitations, their possible solutions, and recommendations for further use of the modeling technique.},

  abstract = {Recently, attachment-informed researchers and clinicians have begun to show that attachment theory offers a useful framework for exploring group psychotherapy. However, it remains unclear whether patients with differing attachment classifications would behave and speak in distinct ways in group therapy sessions. Aim: In this study, we conducted an exploratory analysis of the discourse of patients in group therapy who had independently received different classifications with gold standard interview measures of attachment in adults. Each patient participant attended one of three mentalization-based parenting groups. Before treatment, the Adult Attachment Interview (AAI) or the Parent Development Interview (PDI) were administered to each patient, and interviews were transcribed and coded to obtain the patient's attachment classification. Groups included 2, 5, and 5 patients, respectively, and any session was led by at least two co-therapists. A total of 14 group sessions were transcribed verbatim. Sessions were analysed through a semi-inductive method, in order to identify markers that would typify patients of different attachment classifications in session. Through transcript excerpts and narrative descriptions, we report on the differing ways in which patients of different attachment classifications communicate in group psychotherapy, with the therapist and with each other. Our work provides useful information for group therapists and researchers regarding how differences in attachment status may play out in group sessions.},
